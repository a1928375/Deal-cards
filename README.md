# Deal-cards

1. Deal numhands hands (shuffle cards): Write a function, deal(numhands, n=5, deck), that deals numhands hands with n cards each. This builds a deck of 52 cards.

2. Straight and flush (set()): Define two functions, straight(ranks) and flush(hand). Keep in mind that ranks will be ordered from largest to smallest.

3. Poker: Return a list of winning hands: poker([hand,...]) => [hand,...]

4. Poker (refactored): Refactor the hand_rank function. Return a value indicating how high the hand ranks. Counts is the count of each rank; ranks list corressponding ranks. E.g. '7 T 7 9 7' => counts = (3,1,1); ranks = (7,10,9)
